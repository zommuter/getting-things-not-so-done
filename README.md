# getting things not-so-done
Getting things done? Not with us!

Welcome to my [never-ending quest for](http://drawntogether.wikia.com/wiki/Xandir) the perfect software for... everything? So probably my major problem is that I'm looking for a unification of things like project management, issue tracking, tagging system, digital assets management system and let's throw in a cryptocoin miner while we're at it...

So, what are you, esteemed reader, up for? I'm not sure yet myself. I'm just dumping my thoughts here, and frankly at the moment I'm wondering how you even will have ended up here. But for the sake of practive, I'll use github pages in a few commits to turn this into a website. And while we're at it, I'll try to figure out how to combine that with a commenting system (I find [this one](https://github.com/wireddown/ghpages-ghcomments/tree/master) rather interesting), or even with anotation via https://web.hypothes.is/ or the likes. Maybe a hybrid? And there you may already spot my problem, best summarized by whom else but XKCD:

You might also notice my spelling will contain errors. I'm too lazy to pull and locally edit this file, and github's online editor assumes code. But ah, I just used Firefox's "inspect element" to change the `<div class="CodeMirror-code">`'s `spellcheck="true"`, so now my spelling will improve :+1: But of course I don't want to manually modify this all the time again, so now I'll either have to find an actually github setting or learn enough Greasemonkey (or is Stylish enough?) to fix this...
