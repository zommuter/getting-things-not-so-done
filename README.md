# getting things not-so-done
Getting things done? Not with us!

Welcome to my [never-ending quest for](http://drawntogether.wikia.com/wiki/Xandir) the perfect software for... everything? So probably my major problem is that I'm looking for a unification of things like project management, issue tracking, tagging system, digital assets management system, (code) editor and let's throw in a cryptocoin miner while we're at it...

So, what are you, esteemed reader, up for? I'm not sure yet myself. I'm just dumping my thoughts here, and frankly at the moment I'm wondering how you even will have ended up here. But for the sake of practice, I'll use GitHub pages in a few commits to turn this into a website. And while we're at it, I'll try to figure out how to combine that with a commenting system (I find [this one](https://github.com/wireddown/ghpages-ghcomments/tree/master) rather interesting), or even with annotation via https://web.hypothes.is/ or the likes. Maybe a hybrid? And there you may already spot my problem, best summarized by whom else but XKCD:

![[](https://xkcd.com/761/)](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/dfs.png "A breadth-first search makes a lot of sense for dating in general, actually; it suggests dating a bunch of people casually before getting serious, rather than having a series of five-year relationships one after the other.")

You might also notice my spelling will contain errors. I'm too lazy to pull and locally edit this file, and GitHub's online editor assumes code. But ah, I just used Firefox's "inspect element" to change the `<div class="CodeMirror-code">`'s `spellcheck="true"`, so now my spelling will improve :+1: But of course I don't want to manually modify this all the time again, so now I'll either have to find an actually GitHub setting or learn enough Greasemonkey (or is Stylish enough?) to fix this... OK, so according to https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/ GitHub is using https://codemirror.net/ (the `class` above might have given that away, but it's been a while since I checked up on online code editors). And maybe [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/q/12343922/321973) is helpful here. Did I mention I :heart: the StackExchange network? Not yet, but I'll certainly mention and use it a lot! (Note to self: check the emoji chart, obviously a survival skill these days... And does Markdown still not support footnotes?)
